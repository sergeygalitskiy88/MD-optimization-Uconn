	1)  General. (FORTRAN 2003 +)
	
	ALLOCATE (alloc-list [, STAT=stat-var][, SOURCE=src-ref],ERRMSG= errmsg_variable)
	
		stat_variable 					A scalar integer variable.  status of allocation
		errmsg_variable (Fortran 2003)	A scalar character variable. code of error
		source_expr (Fortran 2003)		An expression which is scalar or has the same rank as allocate_object. not vvery needed
		
	2) In procedure automative arrays should be allocated (automatically remove after procedure ends)
	
	3) !!! Procedures with arrays as parameters !! Two variants to maintain
		3.1) Structure of such procdure should be described in module + use in prog
		3.2) additionaly transfer the size of parameter arrays into subroutine
	 
	4) for lafre arrays transfer into procedure: ....?
